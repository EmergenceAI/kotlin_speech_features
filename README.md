# üìí Introduction
<p align="center">
This library is a complete port of <a href="https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features"> python_speech_features</a> in pure Kotlin. </p>
<p align="center">
It provides common speech features for Automated speech recognition (ASR) including MFCCs and filterbank energies. 
<br>To know more about MFCCs <a href="http://www.practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/guide-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients-mfccs/">read more</a>.
	
### Features

- Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (mfcc)
- Filterbank Energies (fbank)
- Log Filterbank Energies (logfbank)
- Spectral Subband Centroids (ssc)

</p>


# üôã How to use

We support multiple platforms using Kotlin multiplatform. 

<details>
<summary> Android </summary>
	
## Integration
Add jitpack.io to your project's repositories:

```gradle
allProjects {
  repositories {
    google() 
    maven { url "https://www.jitpack.io" }
  }
}
```

Add artifact to your project:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "org.merlyn.kotlinspeechfeatures:${version}"
}
```
	

## Example implementation

A sample app is included in this repo to help understand the implementation.

1. Convert your audio signal in the form of a float array. (A demo provided in the sample app)
2. Initialize speech features
	```kotlin
	private val speechFeatures = SpeechFeatures()
	```
3. Perform any of the 4 operations:
	```kotlin
	val result = speechFeatures.mfcc(MathUtils.normalize(wav), nFilt = 64)	
	val result = speechFeatures.fbank(MathUtils.normalize(wav), nFilt = 64)
	val result = speechFeatures.logfbank(MathUtils.normalize(wav), nFilt = 64)
	val result = speechFeatures.ssc(MathUtils.normalize(wav), nFilt = 64)
	```
4. The result will contain a 2 dimensional matrix with the expected values.

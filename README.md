# üìí Introduction
<p align="center">
This library is a complete port of <a href="https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features"> python_speech_features</a> in pure Kotlin. </p>
<p align="center">
It provides common speech features for Automated speech recognition (ASR) including MFCCs and filterbank energies.
<br>To know more about MFCCs <a href="http://www.practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/guide-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients-mfccs/">read more</a>.

### Features

- Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (mfcc)
- Filterbank Energies (fbank)
- Log Filterbank Energies (logfbank)
- Spectral Subband Centroids (ssc)

</p>


# üôã How to use

We support multiple platforms using Kotlin multiplatform.

<details>
<summary> Android </summary>

## Integration
Add jitpack.io to your project's repositories:

```gradle
allProjects {
  repositories {
    google()
    maven { url "https://www.jitpack.io" }
  }
}
```

Add artifact to your project:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "org.merlyn.kotlinspeechfeatures:${version}"
}
```


## Example implementation

A sample app is included in this repo to help understand the implementation.

1. Convert your audio signal in the form of a float array. (A demo provided in the sample app)
2. Initialize speech features
	```kotlin
	private val speechFeatures = SpeechFeatures()
	```
3. Perform any of the 4 operations:
	```kotlin
	val result = speechFeatures.mfcc(MathUtils.normalize(wav), nFilt = 64)
	val result = speechFeatures.fbank(MathUtils.normalize(wav), nFilt = 64)
	val result = speechFeatures.logfbank(MathUtils.normalize(wav), nFilt = 64)
	val result = speechFeatures.ssc(MathUtils.normalize(wav), nFilt = 64)
	```
4. The result will contain a 2 dimensional matrix with the expected values.

## Integration

1. In XCode, go to `File > Add Packages...`
2. Paste in the URL of this repo in the search box
3. Select the package found
4. Click `Add Package` button


## Example implementation

A sample app is included in this repo to help understand the implementation.

1. Convert your audio signal in the form of an `KotlinIntArray` and normalize it.
   ```swift
   import KotlinSpeechFeatures

   let signal = [Int](1...1000) // Example signal
   let normalized = MathUtils.Companion.init().normalize(sig: toKotlinIntArray(arr: signal))

   func toKotlinIntArray(arr: [Int]) -> KotlinIntArray {
       let result = KotlinIntArray(size: Int32(arr.capacity))
       for i in 0...(arr.count-1) {
           result.set(index: Int32(i), value: Int32(arr[i]))
       }
       return result
   }
   ```
3. Initialize speech features
   ```swift
   let speechFeatures = SpeechFeatures()
   ```
4. Perform any of the 4 operations:
   ```swift
   let result = speechFeatures.mfcc(signal: normalized, sampleRate: 16000, winLen: 0.025, winStep: 0.01, numCep: 13, nFilt: 64, nfft: 512, lowFreq: 0, highFreq: ni;, preemph: 0.97, ceplifter: 22, appendEnergy: true, winFunc: nil)
   let result = speechFeatures.fbank(signal: normalized, sampleRate: 16000, winLen: 0.025, winStep: 0.01, nFilt: 64, nfft: 512, lowFreq: 0, highFreq: nil, preemph: 0.97, winFunc: nil)
   let result = speechFeatures.logfbank(signal: normalized, sampleRate: 16000, winLen: 0.025, winStep: 0.01, nFilt: 64, nfft: 512, lowFreq: 0, highFreq: nil, preemph: 0.97, winFunc: nil)
   let result = speechFeatures.ssc(signal: normalized, sampleRate: 16000, winLen: 0.025, winStep: 0.01, nFilt: 64, nfft: 512, lowFreq: 0, highFreq: nil, preemph: 0.97, winFunc: nil)
   ```
